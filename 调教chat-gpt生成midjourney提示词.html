<h3 id="第一步">第一步：</h3>
<p>Hello ，Today we are gonna create Images with a Diffusion model. I am gonna feed you some information about it. okey?</p>
<h3 id="第二步">第二步：</h3>
<p>This is how Midjourney work:
Midjourney is another AI-powered tool that generates images from user prompts. MidJourney is proficient at adapting actual art styles to create an image of any combination of things the user wants. It excels at creating environments, especially fantasy and sci-fi scenes, with dramatic lighting   that looks like rendered concept art from a video game.  How does Midjourney work?
Midjourney is an AI image generation tool that takes inputs through text prompts and parameters and uses a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm  trained on a large amount of image data to produce unique images.   is powered by Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), a cutting-edge text-to-image synthesis technique. Before understanding how LDMs work, let us look at what Diffusion models are and why we need LDMs.
Diffusion models (DM) are transformer-based generative models that take a piece of data, for example, an image, and gradually add noise over time until it is not recognizable. From
that point, they try reconstructing the image to its original form, and in doing so, they learn how to generate pictures or other data.
The issue with DMs is that the powerful ones often consume hundreds of GPU days, and inference is quite expensive due to sequential
evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources without compromising their quality as well as flexibility, DMs are applied in the latent space of powerful pre-trained autoencoders.
Training a diffusion model on such a representation makes it possible to achieve an optimal point between complexity reduction and detail
preservation, significantly improving visual fidelity. Introducing a cross-attention layer to the model architecture turns the diffusion model into a powerful and flexible generator for generally conditioned inputs such as text and bounding boxes, enabling high-resolution convolution-based  synthesis.

<p>Version
Light
Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. The latest model is the default, but other models can be used using the &ndash;version or &ndash;v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Different models excel at
different types of images. Newest Model
The Midjourney V5 model is the newest and most advanced model, released on March 15th, 2023. To use this model, add the &ndash;v 5 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select  MJ Version 5
This model has very high Coherency, excels at interpreting natural language prompts, is higher resolution, and supports advanced features like repeating patterns with &ndash;tile  To turn it on type &ndash;v 5 after your prompt or select &ldquo;V5&rdquo; from /settings
What&rsquo;s new with the V5 base model?</p>
<ul>
<li>Much wider stylistic range and more responsive to prompting</li>
<li>Much higher image quality (2x resolution increase) improved dynamic range</li>
<li>More detailed images. Details more likely to be correct. Less unwanted text.</li>
<li>Improved performance with image prompting</li>
<li>Supports &ndash;tile argument for seamless tiling (experimental)</li>
<li>Supports &ndash;ar aspect ratios greater than 2:1 (experimental)</li>
<li>Supports &ndash;iw for weighing image prompts versus text prompts
Style and prompting for V5</li>
<li>Today’s test is basically a ‘pro’ mode of the model.</li>
<li>It’s MUCH more ‘unopinionated’ than v3 and v4, and is tuned to provide a wide diversity of outputs and to be very responsive to your inputs. - The tradeoff here is that it may be harder to use. Short prompts may not work as well. You should try to write longer, more explicit text about what you want (ie: “cinematic photo with dramatic lighting”)</li>
<li>Please chat with each other in prompt-chat to figure out how to use v5.</li>
<li>We hope to have a ‘friendly’ default styling for v5 before we switch it to default. When this happens we will still let you turn it off and get back to something like this ‘raw’ mode today.
Please note</li>
<li>This is an alpha test and things will change. DO NOT rely on this exact model being available in the future. It will be significantly modified as we take V5 to full release.</li>
<li>Right now there is no V5 upsampler, the default resolution of V5 is the same as upscaled V4. If you click upscale it will just instantly give you that one image by itself.
Community Standards:</li>
<li>This model can generate much more realistic imagery than anything we&rsquo;ve released before.</li>
<li>We’ve increased the number of moderators, improved moderation tooling, and will be enforcing our community standards with increased strictness and rigor. Don&rsquo;t be a jerk or create images to cause drama.
More about V5:
V5 is our second model trained on our AI supercluster and has been in the works for 5 months. It uses significantly different neural architectures and new aesthetic techniques. V5 isn&rsquo;t the final step, but we hope you all feel the progression of something deep and unfathomable in the power of our collective human imagination.
